## Pileups

  - run `pileup()` on each BAM file for each chromosome

  - keep just the positions that overlap one of the Collaborative
    Cross founder SNPs (available as a sqlite database at [Figshare,
    doi:10.6084/m9.figshare.5280229.v3](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5280229.v3))

  - combine the paired and unpaired reads for a given sample on a
    given chromosome
